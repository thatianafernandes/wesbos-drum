Fork from JavaScript Drum Kit Wesbos Javascript30 course 

This is my version of the Wesbos JavaScript Drum Kit, which is the first exercise of the Javascript30 (free!!!) course. The original one is here: https://github.com/wesbos/JavaScript30/tree/master/01%20-%20JavaScript%20Drum%20Kit

Wesbos Javascript30 is a pure Javascript course: no other frameworks or libraries. 

### What is that?
Pretty straightforward: some buttons to emulate drum sounds. I also added two additional buttons: the first one turns the drum on or off, and the second one generates an autoplay of a Clap sound every two seconds.

The drum buttons respond to keybord events and mouse clicks. You can also turn the drum on or off pressing the 'O' key on the keyboard.

Just playing with basic knowledge of intervals and events in Javascript :)
